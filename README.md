## Project Brief

Build the system that Pinterest uses to analyse both historical, and real-time data generated by posts from their users.

Pinterest has world-class machine learning engineering systems. They have billions of user interactions such as image uploads or image clicks which they need to process every day to inform the decisions to make. In this project, I am building a system in the cloud that takes in those events and runs them through two separate pipelines. One for computing real-time metrics (such as profile popularity, which would be used to recommend that profile in real-time), and another for computing metrics that depend on historical data (such as the most popular category this year).

## Project Dependencies

In order to run this project, the following modules need to be installed:

- `python-dotenv`
- `sqlalchemy`
- `requests`

If you are using Anaconda and virtual environments (recommended), the Conda environment can be cloned by running the following
command, ensuring that env.yml is present in the project:

`conda create env -f env.yml -n $ENVIRONMENT_NAME`

## The data

In order to emulate the kind of data that Pinterest's engineers are likely to work with, this project contains a script, [user_posting_emulation_to_console.py](user_posting_scripts/user_posting_emulation_to_console.py) that when run from the terminal mimics the stream of random data points received by the Pinterest API when POST requests are made by users uploading data to Pinterest.

Running the script instantiates a database connector class, which is used to connect to an AWS RDS database containing the following tables:

- `pinterest_data` contains data about posts being updated to Pinterest
- `geolocation_data` contains data about the geolocation of each Pinterest post found in pinterest_data
- `user_data` contains data about the user that has uploaded each post found in pinterest_data

The `run_infinite_post_data_loop()` method infinitely iterates at random intervals between 0 and 2 seconds, selecting all columns of a random row from each of the three tables and writing the data to a dictionary. The three dictionaries are then printed to the console.

Examples of the data generated look like the following:

pinterest_data:
```
{'index': 7528, 'unique_id': 'fbe53c66-3442-4773-b19e-d3ec6f54dddf', 'title': 'No Title Data Available', 'description': 'No description available Story format', 'poster_name': 'User Info Error', 'follower_count': 'User Info Error', 'tag_list': 'N,o, ,T,a,g,s, ,A,v,a,i,l,a,b,l,e', 'is_image_or_video': 'multi-video(story page format)', 'image_src': 'Image src error.', 'downloaded': 0, 'save_location': 'Local save in /data/mens-fashion', 'category': 'mens-fashion'}
```

geolocation_data:
```
{'ind': 7528, 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2020, 8, 28, 3, 52, 47), 'latitude': -89.9787, 'longitude': -173.293, 'country': 'Albania'}
```

user_data:
```
{'ind': 7528, 'first_name': 'Abigail', 'last_name': 'Ali', 'age': 20, 'date_joined': datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 24, 11, 23, 51)}
```

## Tools used

- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) - Apache Kafka is an event streaming platform. From the Kafka [documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/):
>Event streaming is the practice of capturing data in real-time from event sources like databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services, and software applications in the form of streams of events; storing these event streams durably for later retrieval; manipulating, processing, and reacting to the event streams in real-time as well as retrospectively; and routing the event streams to different destination technologies as needed. Event streaming thus ensures a continuous flow and interpretation of data so that the right information is at the right place, at the right time.

## Building the pipeline

### Create an Apache cluster using AWS MSK

The first stop in the pipeline for our data will be an Apache Kafka cluster in the AWS cloud ecosystem, using [Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/). The documentation includes a good guide for [getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html) and I will outline the steps taken to get a cluster up and running here.

1. Firstly, log into the AWS console and navigate to MSK via the 'Services' menu.
2. From the MSK menu, click on 'Create cluster' to start the process.
3. Here, choose from 'quick' or 'custom' create options and name the cluster:

<img src="images/apache-msk-1.png" alt="create Apache cluster" width="500"/>

4. Scroll down and choose 'Provisioned' and specify the Kafka version and broker type. The type chosen will depend on requirements and cost considerations.

<img src="images/apache-msk-2.png" alt="kafka provisioned and broker type" width="500"/>

5. Finally, scroll down and click 'Create cluster'. The cluster can take between 15 and 20 minutes to create. When the cluster has been created, navigate to the 'Properties' tab, locate the network settings and take a note of the security group associated with the cluster. Next, click on 'View client information' and take a note of the bootstrap servers.

### Create a client machine for the cluster

Once the cluster is up and running, a client is needed to communicate with it. In this project, an EC2 instance is used to act as the client.

1. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard and click on 'Launch Instance':

<img src="images/ec2-launch-instance.png" alt="launch ec2 instance" width="500"/>

2. Give the instance a name, e.g. 'pinterest-kafka-client'.
3. Keep the default Application and OS images, and instance type. Again, this choice may be determined by usage and cost considerations.

<img src="images/ec2-OS-images.png" alt="ec2 OS image options" width="500"/>

4. Create a new keypair for connecting securely to the instance via SSH. Give the keypair a descriptive name and choose 'RSA' and '.pem' for the type and file format, respectively. The .pem file will automatically download - keep this file safe for later use.

<img src="images/ec2-key-pair.png" alt="ec2 key pair options" width="500"/>

5. Keep the default settings for the other sections. Click on 'Launch Instance' in the right-hand summary menu.

### Enable client machine to connect to the cluster

In order for the client machine to connect to the cluster, we need to edit the inbound rules for the security group associated with the cluster.

1. In the left-hand EC2 menu, click on 'Security Groups'.
2. Select the security group associated with the Kafka cluster (noted earlier).
3. Select the 'Inbound rules' tab and then click on 'Edit inbound rules'.
4. Click on 'Add rule'. Choose 'All traffic' for the type, and then select the security group associated with the EC2 instance.
5. Save the rules.

We also need to create an IAM role for the client machine.

1. Navigate to the AWS IAM dashboard, select 'Roles' from the left-hand menu and then click on 'Create role'.
2. Select 'AWS service' and 'EC2', then click on 'Next'.
3. On the next page, select 'Create policy'.
4. In the policy editor, choose JSON format and paste in the following policy. **Note: this policy is somewhat open - a more restrictive policy would be more appropriate for a production environment**

```bash
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kafka:ListClustersV2",
                "kafka:ListVpcConnections",
                "kafka:DescribeClusterOperation",
                "kafka:GetCompatibleKafkaVersions",
                "kafka:ListClusters",
                "kafka:ListKafkaVersions",
                "kafka:GetBootstrapBrokers",
                "kafka:ListConfigurations",
                "kafka:DescribeClusterOperationV2"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "kafka-cluster:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:kafka:*:<AWS-UUID>:transactional-id/*/*/*",
                "arn:aws:kafka:*:<AWS-UUID>:group/*/*/*",
                "arn:aws:kafka:*:<AWS-UUID>:topic/*/*/*",
                "arn:aws:kafka:*:<AWS-UUID>:cluster/*/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor2",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "kafka:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:kafka:*:<AWS-UUID>:cluster/*/*",
                "arn:aws:kafka:*:<AWS-UUID>:configuration/*/*",
                "arn:aws:kafka:*:<AWS-UUID>:vpc-connection/*/*/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

5. On the next page, give the policy a descriptive name and save the policy.
6. Back in the create role tab in the browser, click refresh to show the new policy and select the policy.
7. Click 'Next', give the role a descriptive name and save the role.
8. In the EC2 dashboard, click on the client instance.
9. Under 'Actions' and 'Security', click on 'Modify IAM role'.
10. Select the role just created and click on 'Update IAM role'.

### Install Kafka on the client machine

1. Once the new instance is in the running state, connect via SSH to interact with the instance using the command line. To do this, click on the instance ID to open the summary page, then click on 'Connect':

<img src="images/connect-to-ec2.png" alt="ec2 connect" width="500"/>

2. Follow the instructions in the 'SSH' tab to connect to the instance.

```bash
# make sure key is not publicly viewable
chmod 400 pinterest-kafka-client-keypair.pem
# connect
ssh -i "pinterest-kafka-client-keypair.pem" ec2-user@<instance-public-DNS>
```

3. Now on the instance command line:

```bash
# install Java - required for Kafka to run
sudo yum install java-1.8.0
# download Kafka - must be same version as MSK cluster created earlier
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.8.1/kafka_2.12-2.8.1.tgz
# unpack .tgz
tar -xzf kafka_2.12-2.8.1.tgz
```

4. Install the [MSK IAM package](https://github.com/aws/aws-msk-iam-auth) that will enable the MSK cluster to authenticate the client:

```bash
# navigate to the correct directory
cd kafka_2.12-2.8.1/libs/
# download the package
wget https://github.com/aws/aws-msk-iam-auth/releases/download/v1.1.5/aws-msk-iam-auth-1.1.5-all.jar
```

5. Configure the client to be able to use the IAM package:

```bash
# open bash config file
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add the following line to the config file, then save and exit:

```bash
export CLASSPATH=/home/ec2-user/kafka_2.12-2.8.1/libs/aws-msk-iam-auth-1.1.5-all.jar
```

Continue with configuration:

```bash
# activate changes to .bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
# navigate to Kafka bin folder
cd ../bin
# create client.properties file
nano client.properties
```

Add the following code to the client.properties file, then save and exit:

```bash
# Sets up TLS for encryption and SASL for authN.
security.protocol = SASL_SSL

# Identifies the SASL mechanism to use.
sasl.mechanism = AWS_MSK_IAM

# Binds SASL client implementation.
sasl.jaas.config = software.amazon.msk.auth.iam.IAMLoginModule required;

# Encapsulates constructing a SigV4 signature based on extracted credentials.
# The SASL client bound by "sasl.jaas.config" invokes this class.
sasl.client.callback.handler.class = software.amazon.msk.auth.iam.IAMClientCallbackHandler
```

### Create topics on the Kafka cluster

It is now possible to create topics on the Kafka cluster using the client machine command line. The command for creating topics is as follows. Use the boostrap server string noted earlier after cluster creation.

```bash
<path-to-your-kafka-installation>/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server <BootstrapServerString> --command-config client.properties --topic <topic name>
```

For this project, I created three topics. One each for the `pinterest_data`, `geolocation_data`, and `user_data` outlined above.

### Delivering messages to the Kafka cluster

Now that our cluster is up and running, and the client is configured to access the cluster and create topics, it's possible to use the client to create producers for streaming messages to the cluster, and consumers for accessing those messages.

However, for this project I used the Confluent package to set up a REST API on the client that listens for requests and interacts with the Kafka cluster accordingly.

To do this, first download the Confluent package to the client from the client's command line:

```bash
# download package
sudo wget https://packages.confluent.io/archive/7.2/confluent-7.2.0.tar.gz
# unpack .tar
tar -xvzf confluent-7.2.0.tar.gz 
```

Next, modify the kafka-rest.properties file:

```bash
# navigate to the correct directory
cd cd confluent-7.2.0/etc/kafka-rest/
nano nano kafka-rest.properties
```

Change the `bootstrap.servers` and the `zookeeper.connect` variables to those found in the MSK cluster information. Add the following lines to allow authentication:

```bash
# Sets up TLS for encryption and SASL for authN.
client.security.protocol = SASL_SSL

# Identifies the SASL mechanism to use.
client.sasl.mechanism = AWS_MSK_IAM

# Binds SASL client implementation.
client.sasl.jaas.config = software.amazon.msk.auth.iam.IAMLoginModule required;

# Encapsulates constructing a SigV4 signature based on extracted credentials.
# The SASL client bound by "sasl.jaas.config" invokes this class.
client.sasl.client.callback.handler.class = software.amazon.msk.auth.iam.IAMClientCallbackHandler
```

The inbound rules for the client security group also need to be modified to allow incoming HTTP requests on port 8082. On the AWS 'Security groups' page, choose the security group attached to the client, and add the following inbound rule:

<img src="images/client-http-inbound-rules.png" alt="ec2 connect" width="1000"/>

To start the REST API, navigate to the `confluent-7.2.0/bin` folder and run the following command:

```bash
./kafka-rest-start /home/ec2-user/confluent-7.2.0/etc/kafka-rest/kafka-rest.properties
```

The API's ability to receive requests can be tested by opening a web browser and going to "http://your-client-public-dns:8082/topics". The response should be displayed in the browser window and look something like:

```bash
["data.pin","data.user","__amazon_msk_canary","data.geo"]
```

For this project, to more easily connect to the API programmatically using different request methods I set up an API gateway on AWS.

### AWS API Gateway

Navigate to the AWS API Gateway service. This project uses a REST API.

1. Click on 'Build' in the REST API box:

<img src="images/rest-api-build.png" alt="ec2 connect" width="1000"/>

2. Choose 'REST', 'New API', give the API a descriptive name, then click on 'Create API':

<img src="images/rest-api-build-2.png" alt="ec2 connect" width="500"/>

3. From the 'Actions' menu, choose 'Create resource'. Select 'Configure as proxy resource' and 'Enable API Gateway CORS' boxes, then click on 'Create resource':

<img src="images/rest-api-create-resource.png" alt="ec2 connect" width="1000"/>

4. On the next page, set up HTTP Proxy, using the address for earlier as the endpoint, "http://your-client-public-dns:8082/{proxy}":

<img src="images/rest-api-create-method.png" alt="ec2 connect" width="1000"/>

5. With the resource and method created, it's possible to test the API (make sure that the REST proxy on the client is running and listening for requests). If everything is working correctly, the following test should result in a 200 response code and the same response body obtained through the browser:

<img src="images/rest-api-test-method.png" alt="ec2 connect" width="500"/>

6. Now the API needs to be deployed. From the 'Actions' menu, select 'Deploy API'. Choose 'New stage' and give the stage a name, then click on 'Deploy':

<img src="images/rest-api-deploy.png" alt="ec2 connect" width="500"/>

This completes the process and an invoke URL is generated that can then be used for POST requests.

### Sending messages to the cluster using the API gateway

Running the script [user_posting_emulation_batch_data.py](user_posting_scripts/user_posting_emulation_batch_data.py) will emulate a stream of messages and post those messages to the cluster via the API gateway and the Kafka REST proxy.

In order to access the messages in each topic in the cluster, I have used Kafka Connect, using AWS MSK Connect, to connect the cluster to an AWS S3 bucket into which messages can be deposited.

### Connecting the Apache cluster to AWS S3 bucket

To start with, create an S3 bucket that will connect to the cluster.

1. From the AWS S3 dashboard, select 'Create bucket'
2. Give the bucket a descriptive name (must be unique) and make sure the bucket is in the same AWS region as the rest of the project resources. Keep other settings as default.

Next, create an IAM role for the MSK connector using the following policy. **Again, this policy may not be restrictive enough for production purposes. I am using this for development only.**:

            "Resource": "arn:aws:kafka:<REGION>:<AWS-UUID>:topic/<CLUSTER-NAME>/<CLUSTER-UUID>/__amazon_msk_connect_*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor4",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kafka-cluster:AlterGroup",
                "kafka-cluster:DescribeGroup"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:kafka:<REGION>:<AWS-UUID>:group/<CLUSTER-NAME>/<CLUSTER-UUID>/__amazon_msk_connect_*",
                "arn:aws:kafka:<REGION>:<AWS-UUID>:group/<CLUSTER-NAME>/<CLUSTER-UUID>/connect-*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor5",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListStorageLensConfigurations",

            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

The role should have the following trust relationship:

```bash
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "kafkaconnect.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

The next step is to create a VPC endpoint to S3. From the VPC dashboard in AWS, select 'Endpoints' from the left-hand menu then click on 'Create endpoint'. Give the endpoint a descriptive name, then select 'AWS services'. Search for 'S3' in the 'Services' search field, then select:

<img src="images/vpc-endpoint.png" alt="vpc-endpoint-creation" width="1000">

Choose the default VPC for the region, click the check box next to the default route tables, then click on 'Create endpoint'.

We're now ready to create the connector. The first step is to create a new plugin for the connector.

1. To create the plugin, a .zip file with the plugin files is required. For the Kafka S3 Sink Connector, this can be downloaded from "https://www.confluent.io/hub/confluentinc/kafka-connect-s3". Once downloaded, it should be uploaded to the S3 bucket, either via the console or via a web browser.
2. In the AWS MSK dashboard, select 'Custom plugins' from the left-hand menu, then click on 'Create custom plugin'.
3. In the next window, navigate to the S3 bucket where the .zip is stored, and select the .zip file:

<img src="images/custom-plugin.png" alt="custom-plugin-creation" width="500">

4. Click on 'Create custom plugin'. The process will take a few minutes.

Now create the connector. Navigate to 'Connectors' in the left-hand menu of the MSK dashboard.

1. Click on 'Create connector'.
2. Select 'Use existing plugin' and select the plugin just created. Click 'Next'.
3. Give the connector a name, make sure 'MSK cluster' is highlighted, then select the cluster created earlier.
4. Use the following settings for the configuration:

```bash
connector.class=io.confluent.connect.s3.S3SinkConnector
# same region as our bucket and cluster
s3.region=<REGION>
flush.size=1
schema.compatibility=NONE
tasks.max=3
# this depends on names given to topics
topics.regex=<TOPIC-NAME>.*
format.class=io.confluent.connect.s3.format.json.JsonFormat
partitioner.class=io.confluent.connect.storage.partitioner.DefaultPartitioner
value.converter.schemas.enable=false
value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter
storage.class=io.confluent.connect.s3.storage.S3Storage
key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
s3.bucket.name=<BUCKET_NAME>
```

5. Choose defaults for remaining settings until 'Access Permissions', where the IAM role created for the connector should be selected.
6. Click 'Next', then 'Next' again. Select a location for log delivery. I selected to have logs delivered to the S3 bucket.
7. Click 'Next' and then 'Create connector'.

Once the connector creation process is complete, you should be able to see any messages sent to the cluster in the S3 bucket, inside a folder named 'Topics'.

## Batch processing data using Apache Spark on Databricks

In order to batch process the data on Databricks, it's necessary to mount the S3 bucket on the platform. The file [mount_s3_and_get_data.ipynb](databricks_notebooks/mount_s3_and_get_data.ipynb) is a notebook that was run on the Databricks platform. The steps carried out in the notebook are:

1. Import necessary libraries
2. List tables in Databricks filestore in order to obtain AWS credentials file name
3. Read the credentials .csv into a Spark dataframe
4. Generate credential variables from Spark dataframe
5. Mount the S3 bucket containing the messages from the Kafka topics
6. List the topics
7. Read the .json message files into three Spark dataframes, one each for each of the topics
8. Unmount the S3 bucket

### Clean data using Apache Spark on Databricks

The file [clean_batch_data.ipynb](databricks_notebooks/clean_batch_data.ipynb) contains the code for performing the necessary cleaning of the dataframes created using the steps above. On Databricks, this code is hosted in a single notebook, and the cleaning steps occur between steps 7. and 8. above.

### Querying the data using Apache Spark on Databricks

The file [query_batch_data.ipynb](databricks_notebooks/query_batch_data.ipynb) contains the code for querying the dataframes and returning specific insights about the data. On Databricks, this code was run after the cleaning steps above.

### Orchestrating automated workflow of notebook on Databricks

MWAA was used to automate the process of running the batch processing on Databricks. The file [1215be80977f_dag.py](1215be80977f_dag.py) is the Python code for a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that orchestrates the running of the batch processing notebook described above. The file was uploaded to the MWAA environment, where Airflow is utilised to connect to and run the Databricks notebook at scheduled intervals, in this case `@daily`.

## Processing streaming data

### Create data streams on Kinesis

The first step in processing streaming data was to create three streams on AWS Kinesis, one for each of the data sources.

1. From the Kinesis dashboard, select 'Create data stream'.

<img src="images/kinesis-dashboard.png" alt="kinesis dashboard screenshot" width="500">

2. Give the stream a name, and select 'Provisioned' capacity mode.

<img src="images/create-stream.png" alt="create stream screenshot" width="500">

3. Click on 'Create data stream' to complete the process.

### Create API proxy for uploading data to streams

It's possible to interact with the Kinesis streams using HTTP requests. In order to do this with the streams just added to Kinesis, I created new API resources on AWS API Gateway.

The settings used for the DELETE method were:

 - 'Integration Type': 'AWS Service'
 - 'AWS Region': 'us-east-1'
 - 'AWS Service': 'Kinesis'
 - 'HTTP method': 'POST'
 - 'Action': '**DeleteStream**'
 - 'Execution role': 'arn of IAM role created'

<img src="images/delete-method-settings-1.png" alt="delete method settings 1" width="600">

In 'Integration Request' under 'HTTP Headers', add a new header:

- 'Name': 'Content-Type'
- 'Mapped from': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1'

Under 'Mapping Templates', add new mapping template:

- 'Content Type': 'application/json'

Use the following code in the template:

```bash
{
    "StreamName": "$input.params('stream-name')"
}
```

<img src="images/delete-method-settings-2.png" alt="delete method settings 2" width="1000">

For the other methods, the same settings were used except for:

- GET
    - 'Action': '**DescribeStream**'
    - 'Mapping Template':

```bash
{
    "StreamName": "$input.params('stream-name')"
}
```

- POST
    - 'Action': '**CreateStream**'
    - 'Mapping Template':

```bash
{
    "ShardCount": #if($input.path('$.ShardCount') == '') 5 #else $input.path('$.ShardCount') #end,
    "StreamName": "$input.params('stream-name')"
}
```

/record

- PUT
    - 'Action': '**PutRecord**'
    - 'Mapping Template':

```bash
{
    "StreamName": "$input.params('stream-name')",
    "Data": "$util.base64Encode($input.json('$.Data'))",
    "PartitionKey": "$input.path('$.PartitionKey')"
}
```

/records

- PUT
    - 'Action': '**PutRecords**'
    - 'Mapping Template':

```bash
{
    "StreamName": "$input.params('stream-name')",
    "Records": [
       #foreach($elem in $input.path('$.records'))
          {
            "Data": "$util.base64Encode($elem.data)",
            "PartitionKey": "$elem.partition-key"
          }#if($foreach.hasNext),#end
        #end
    ]
}
```

After creating the new resources and methods, the API must be redeployed.

### Sending data to the Kinesis streams

Running the script [user_posting_emulation_stream_data.py](user_posting_scripts/user_posting_emulation_stream_data.py) starts an infinite loop that, like in the examples above, retrieves records from the RDS database and sends them via the new API to Kinesis.

### Processing the streaming data in Databricks

The Jupyter notebook [process_kinesis_streaming_data.ipynb](databricks_notebooks/process_kinesis_streaming_data.ipynb) contains all the code necessary for retrieving the streams from Kinesis, transforming (cleaning) the data, and then loading the data into Delta tables on the Databricks cluster. The steps taken in the code are:

1. Import necessary functions and types
2. List tables in Databricks filestore in order to obtain AWS credentials file name
3. Read the credentials .csv into a Spark dataframe
4. Generate credential variables from Spark dataframe
5. Define functions for:
    - getting streams from Kinesis using spark.readStream - returns dataframe with stream info and data in binary format
    - deserialising the stream data - converts the binary data format to a dataframe using schema defined above
    - writing streaming data to Delta tables using Spark writeStream function
6. Define schema for deserialised data
7. Invoke get_stream function for all three streams
8. Invoke deserialise_stream function for all three streams
9. Clean all three streams
10. Display the streams
11. Write the streams to Delta tables

## Next steps

To take this project further, I think it would be a good idea to further query the streaming data and visualise the data using a tool such as Tableau or Power BI. To further 'production-ise' the code, I'd need to tighten up the IAM policies described above.
